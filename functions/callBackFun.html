    // Callback function is a function which is called after something is done , it calls another function when anything is occured
    // button.addEventListener("click",hello);    // here on clicking the button we have added an event to call hello() function which can be known as call back function 

    // function hello(){
    //   alert(`hey click it  HARD`);
    // }


   // we also have some shorthand methods for callback functions as : 
   button.addEventListener("click", function (){
     alert(`get some fresh air in the morning `);      // we can also use some arrow functions as well.
