    // // Every Objects in javascript have a prototype object , which has the properties of all real objects :

function Player(name,game,country){
  this.name = name,
  this.game = game ,
  this.country =country,
  status = function(){
    console.log(`the player is ${this.name} who plays ${this.game} from ${this.country}`);
  }

};


const player1 = new Player('Ronaldo','football','portugal');
 const player2 = new Player('Messi','football','argentina');


// //prototype is another object through which the original properties are inheritated , just player.prototype is a prototype for player1 and player2 as it return true value below.

// console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(player1) == Player.prototype);
// // console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(player2) == Player.prototype);
// console.log(player2.__proto__ === Player.prototype);

// //all the methods or properties defined on the prototypes will be available on the original objects too.
// Player.prototype.show = function(){
//   console.log('hey this is inside prototype object');
// }

// //this above method defined on prototype can be now accessible to original objects like player1,player2,

// player1.show();
// player2.show();


// we get here below that Player.prototype is inheritated from object.prototype just similar to that of player1 and player2 are inheritated from the player.
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(Player.prototype) === Object.prototype );

//Just as in above We have added a function using Player.prototype {show()} , 
// similarly there are numerous functions under this Object.prototype functions e.g .valueof // .hasOwnProperty and many more like these

// we can used as an example of prototypal inheritance in which the player1 and player2 can use such property of the objects like 

console.log(player1.valueof());
console.log(Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty(valueof()));

  if (true) {
    console.log('this is a claled');
  }
  console.log('how i have done');
